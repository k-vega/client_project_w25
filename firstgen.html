Whether you need help adjusting to college life, managing course loads, or planning your future, we’re here to help you thrive. Housed in the Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives (OAMI), the First Generation Student Gateway serves as a starting point to get connected to resources for first-generation students.</p>
